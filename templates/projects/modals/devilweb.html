<p>As a part of my job at <a href="https://www.mydevil.net">MyDevil.net</a> I've created a front-end interface for the management system (in which creation I have also participated).</p>
<p>The front-end, called DevilWEB2 is created in Python (Django Framework), using Bootstrap 3 and jQuery. It allows any customer to easily manage his hosting account, including the following aspects:</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Websites and DNS zones,</li>
        <li>Mail accounts,</li>
        <li>Databases (MySQL, MongoDB and PostgreSQL),</li>
        <li>FTP accounts,</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>... and many other features.</p>

<p>At the time of creating this page, DevilWEB2 is widely used across all servers and services provided by <a href="https://www.mydevil.net">MyDevil.net</a>. It has proved itself to be fast, secure and has been many times acknowledged as the best, easiest to use web-based management system.</p>
