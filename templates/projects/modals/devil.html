<p>As a part of my job at <a href="https://www.mydevil.net">MyDevil.net</a> I've worked on creating the back-end api for our web and cli management interface.</p>
<p>The back-end, called Devil2 is created in Python (Django Framework), and is the core that manages all services offered by the company. It uses a variety of solutions, including message queues, multi-threaded and multi-processing programming and a variety of libraries, ingluding PostgreSQL and MongoDB.</p>

<p>At the time of creating this page, Devil2 is widely used across all servers and services provided by <a href="https://www.mydevil.net">MyDevil.net</a></p>
