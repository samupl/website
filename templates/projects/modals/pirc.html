<p>This is one of my first projects. The PIRC.PL IRC network is a combination of previously existing linuxstorm, npircs and upnet networks.</p>

<p>The network itself is pretty small, holding about 300 users on-line, but it has a few interesting solutions, for example custom anti-spam modules, or an encoding convertion module (that automatically encodes and decodes various character sets for users, so two people using UTF-8 and ISO8859-2 can talk with each other using special characters).</p>
